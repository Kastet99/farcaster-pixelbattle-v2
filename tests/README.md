# Pixel Battle Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the Pixel Battle project, addressing both the implementation to-do list and risk assessment points from the PRD.

## Test Categories

1. **Unit Tests** - Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests** - Test interactions between components
3. **Smart Contract Tests** - Verify contract functionality and security
4. **Economic Model Tests** - Simulate the game economy
5. **Performance Tests** - Evaluate system under load
6. **End-to-End Tests** - Test complete user flows

## Risk Mitigation Testing

Each risk identified in the PRD has corresponding test cases to mitigate and monitor:

1. **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities**
   - Security audits
   - Formal verification
   - Fuzzing tests
   - Reentrancy attack tests

2. **Scaling Issues**
   - Load testing with simulated users
   - Stress testing at 10x expected capacity
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Transaction Throughput**
   - Batch transaction tests
   - Gas optimization verification
   - Network congestion simulation

4. **Economic Model Risks**
   - Price escalation simulation over time
   - Whale activity simulation
   - Long-term gameplay simulation

## Test Implementation Timeline

1. Unit and integration tests during feature development
2. Smart contract tests before deployment
3. Economic simulation before public launch
4. Performance testing during beta phase
5. Continuous monitoring post-launch
