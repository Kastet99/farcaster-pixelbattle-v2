# Farcaster Pixel Battle

A competitive pixel-based game built on Farcaster Frames where users paint pixels on a shared canvas with an escalating price model.

## Features

- 32Ã—32 pixel grid (1,024 pixels total) with a 16-color palette
- Initial pixel cost: 0.001 ETH
- Price escalation: 1.1x for each repaint
- Revenue split: 84% to previous owner, 15% to prize bank, 1% to developer
- Game ends after 24 hours of inactivity
- Players with most pixels at end of game cycle win
- All pixel owners receive proportional rewards from prize bank
- Batch purchase functionality for efficient pixel acquisition

## Technical Architecture

- Farcaster Mini App as primary interface
- Base (Ethereum L2) blockchain
- Smart contracts for pixel ownership, pricing, and transactions
- Mock implementation for development without blockchain dependencies

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Development Mode

The project includes a mock contract service that simulates blockchain interactions for easier development and testing. This allows you to:

- Test pixel purchases without actual ETH transactions
- Simulate the game's economic model
- Test the UI and user experience without deploying contracts

## Deployment

For production deployment:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm start
```
