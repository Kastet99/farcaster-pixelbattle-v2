I vibe-coded Pixel Battle for fun, inspired by the massive engagement generated by pixel canvas battles elsewhere. This Farcaster-native game reimagines the viral success of Reddit's r/Place (which generated 160M+ users and over 10M pixel changes) and Telegram's Pixels Battle, but with a crypto-economic twist.

## How It Works

Pixel Battle features a shared canvas where users compete for pixel ownership through an innovative escalating price model:

Initial pixel cost: 0.0001 ETH
Each repaint costs 1.1x the previous price
When someone overwrites your pixel, you receive 84% of their payment
15% goes to the final prize pool
1% to development
This creates fascinating dynamics: if your pixel gets overwritten, you earn a 76% ROI. The last person to own each pixel has up to 76% potential return when the game concludes and prizes are distributed.

## Use Cases

Art & Entertainment: Players create beautiful collaborative artwork or engage in pixel wars
Community Engagement: Communities battle for canvas territory and representation
Financialization: Strategic players can treat the canvas as an investment game, buying pixels likely to be overwritten for profit
## Technical Implementation

Built on Farcaster with smart contracts deployed on Base network, featuring:

32Ã—32 pixel canvas with 16-color palette
Game cycles ending after 24 hours of inactivity
Full integration with Farcaster Frames
## Future Features

The roadmap includes color palettes, canvas autoscaling, social features (chat, leaderboard), and unique gameplay elements like stencils, color-bombs, and pixel-blockers. Future DeFi options might include player DAOs competing against whales and AI agents participating in the game.

What started as a fun coding experiment has the potential to drive significant user growth and unprecedented engagement for the Farcaster ecosystem.
